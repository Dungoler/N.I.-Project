# N.I-Proyect
A tool built for those who don't have enough time or want to simplify the process of draw tracing. Wide range of options to catch up and easy to understand, choose from any pre-built way to trace or make your own with the specifications. Easy, Fast and Doable Draw Tracing Made for You.

### What is N.I?
**_N.I_** is a proyect, started in late 2021 and finished early 2023, it started when I needed to simplify the process of draw tracing, using duct tape wasn't practical, as it left traces in the monitor and finding the duct tape isn't always an easy task. So I tought maybe making a folder, with every template i could think of, would be a great idea to stop wasting my time figuring how I am going to put the paper sheet, an here it is, widely featured in options so far.  

This proyect is about **draw tracing**, haven't you ever found yourself needing to draw trace an online image, but you find yourself short on time, without duct tape, or facing other limitations? **_N.I_** is here to fix that, as it brings the opportunity to choose from various templates made for an easy use, just make a tab for the image (right-click/open image in a new tab), hover the mouse in the image, inspect element (right-click/inspect element), make sure you're making changes **ON** the image and paste the code found in the .txt document that you think meets your preference, if you happen to change your mind, just paste the new code in, and if something goes wrong, it would be just enough reason to refresh the page, and try again. 

Good luck in your tracing, remember you can always *change the time until the PC turns in suspended mode*, as not changing this may result in the monitor turning off, and can get annoying over time.  

### What does adjusted or normal does?
This proyect could only get tested on one monitor in a certain resolution (1680 Ã— 1050), so i would say it is an experimental feature that i think has its presence on the majority of monitors, your monitor should have a structure where when you put the blank sheet on the space between the plastic and the screen, you can notice you can either leave the blank sheet to an upper place or slide the paper all the way down, adjusted is for all the way down, and normal is for the upper sustainment. Using adjusted for normal or viceversa will result in an inordinate on the large sides of the sheet, making it so; for example, instead of getting 0.75 CM as the large side margin, you get 0.5, or maybe 1.0. I recommend you to check with a pencil if the chosen code meets the desired requeriment; this is important and delicate, not knowing what you're doing could end in a fresh start, causing you trouble and wasting your time.
