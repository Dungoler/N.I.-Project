**[Traducción al español](https://github.com/Dungoler/N.I.-Project/blob/main/ESPA%C3%91OL.md)**

A tool built for those who don't have enough time or want to simplify the process of tracing. With a wide range of options to catch up on and easy to understand, choose from any pre-built way to trace or make your own with the specifications. Easy, Fast, and Doable Trace drawing for You

### What is _N.I._?
***N.I.*** is a project that started in late 2022 and finished early 2023. It started when I needed to simplify the process of tracing; using duct tape wasn't practical as it left traces on the monitor, and finding the duct tape isn't always an easy task. So I thought maybe making a folder with every template I could think of would be a great idea to stop wasting my time figuring out how I was going to put the paper sheet, and here it is, widely featured in options so far.

This project is about **tracing**. Haven't you ever found yourself needing to trace draw an online image, but you find yourself short on time, without duct tape, or facing other limitations? ***N.I.*** is here to fix that, as it brings the opportunity to choose from various templates made for easy use: just make a tab for the image (right-click/open image in a new tab), hover the mouse in the image, inspect element (right-click/inspect element), make sure you're making changes **ON** the image, and paste the code found in the.txt document that you think meets your preference. If you happen to change your mind, just paste the new code in, and if something goes wrong, it would be just enough reason to refresh the page and try again.

Remember, you can always *change the time until the PC turns into suspended mode*, as not changing this may result in the monitor turning off and can get annoying over time.

### What does adjusted or normal do?
This project could only be tested on one monitor in a certain resolution (1680 × 1050), so I would say it is an experimental feature that I think has its presence on the majority of monitors. Your monitor should have a structure where, when you put the blank sheet on the space between the plastic and the screen, you should notice you can either leave the blank sheet to an upper place or slide the paper all the way down; adjusted is for all the way down; and normal is for the upper sustainment. Using adjusted for normal or vice versa will result in an disproportion on that side of the sheet, making it so; for example, instead of getting 0.75 CM as the large side margin, you get 0.5, or maybe 1.0. I recommend you check with a pencil if the chosen code meets the desired requirement; this is important and delicate; not knowing what you're doing could end in a fresh start, causing you trouble and wasting your time.

The lateral can also be adjusted, but I highly doubt that the majority of monitors do have a structure where you can either adjust the paper at two points on both the left and right. Again, It is highly recommended using a pencil to check, whenever you're about to trace, if the measurement or the proportion is ideal. Not doing so could cause inconveniences.
### Can I opt to make my own measurements for the sheet?
Yes, you can pin them too, customize your way of tracing, adapt to your needs as such to vary the styles, and do whatever you like with the sheet as long as it helps you in your drawing, homework, task, etcetera. You can share this with your partner, friend, co-worker or workmate, you tell. It might help them too! It's always good to have a helping hand within your reach.
## Downloading
Checking the Attachments<sup>**⁴**</sup> is recommended before you set usage, as it could be confusing at first glance.

Download the **latest release**: ***[N.I. v2.1](https://github.com/Dungoler/N.I.-Project/releases/tag/v2.1)***.

>  Check versions [here](https://github.com/Dungoler/N.I.-Project/tags).

>  Submit on [Issues](https://github.com/Dungoler/N.I.-Project/issues).

You could also extract the file if you want; as a folder, personally, it's more practical, but choose what suits you.
## Features
***N.I.*** provides a wide range of options to choose from, you can:

-  Range from normal or adjusted side.
-  Check info to make your own code.
-  Display left or right as preference.
-  Pick from adjusted or normal.
-  Choose background color.
-  Choose margin color.
-  Check changelog.

And mainly, choose from:

- [ ]  1.00 CM margin
- [ ]  0.75 CM margin
- [ ]  0.50 CM margin

You could have more proportions, change the values of:
```
margin-bottom:     Xcm;
margin-right:      Ycm;
margin-left:       Zcm;
margin-top:        Xcm;
height:            Ycm;
width:             Zcm;
```
And add them on a separate folder for your own measurements or share them.

#### If you don't posess WinRAR, consider using another program or Adquire it; there's tutorials up on Youtobe.

Posterior to this step, you should have a folder with the version name, in it you can choose the language you prefer to handle. Formats > A4 > Pure fonts; and select the parameters you think suits you.

### - Set usage
#### IMPORTANT: Measures will likely be off-set in your monitor, i highly recommend using a pencil to check if the measure is correct, if not the case, change the _V-position_ and _H-position_ of your monitor to get full accuracy. Don't know how? Your monitor should have a button somewhere to open a menu, this menu brings the ability to customize both values and more.

For this example, i'm going to be using: "English > Formats > A4 > Pure fonts > Black > Normal lateral > No outline > 1 CM > Normal": **RIGHT**
```
** PAPER SHEET 1 CM NORMAL **

LEFT

    background-color:  black;
    stroke-opacity:    00000;
    margin-bottom:     0.90cm;
    margin-right:      10.4cm;
    margin-left:       0.900cm;
    margin-top:        6.860cm;
    height:            20.010cm;
    cursor:            crosshair;
    width:             26.520000cm;

RIGHT

    width:             26.520000cm;
    cursor:            crosshair;
    height:            20.010cm;
    margin-top:        6.860cm;
    margin-left:       10.40cm;
    margin-right:      0.90cm;
    margin-bottom:     0.90cm;
    stroke-opacity:    00000;
    background-color:  black;
```
Copy everything inside of '**RIGHT**', then find the tab for the image you want to trace. For this example, i'm using an image of the World map. Open the image in a new tab (```Right click``` > ```Open image in a new tab```). Then, enter the tab, enter fullscreen mode and press ```Control``` + ```Shift``` + ```I``` or ```Control``` + ```Shift``` + ```C``` or hover the image, ```Right click``` > ```Inspect```. For '**RIGHT**', you will have to move the Inspect bar to the left. For **LEFT**, the Inspect bar must be in the left. As we're using '**RIGHT**', you will have to move the Inspect bar to the left. **IF YOU'RE USING EDGE BROWSER**: first, you will need to move the Activity bar to the top if not already, press the highlighted button present on the next image:

<img src="https://github.com/Dungoler/N.I.-Project/blob/main/Library/N.I%20Img/Attachments/Img3.png"/>

Now, press the three dots on the top and change the Dock location to the left, as we're working with '**RIGHT**'


**NOTE**: I don´t recommend using edge browser for tracing with N.I.. The reason is because edge has an outline for fullscreen and Non-fullscreen Inspect Element mode; this outline overrides the margin and, for example, instead of having 1 CM of margin, you get 1.10 CM of right and lower margin thus having an unconsistent margin on the sides in terms of measurements either that or a slide bar that will hide part of the image. If you find a way to hide this feature, i would greatly appreciate if you told us about it on [Issues](https://github.com/Dungoler/N.I.-Project/issues).

After doing so, make sure you're making changes on the image, the selected element should start with something like:
```
"<img style="
```
In this case, the must-select HTML element looks like this:
```
<img style="display: block;-webkit-user-select: none;margin: auto;cursor: zoom-in;background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 90%);transition: background-color 300ms;" src="https://mapamundi.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mapamundi-politico-con-nombres-de-paises-para-imprimir.jpg" width="1421" height="741">
```
Finally, click here and paste the code found on **RIGHT**, in the text document:
<p float="left">
<img src="https://github.com/Dungoler/N.I.-Project/blob/main/Library/N.I%20Img/Attachments/Img4.png"/>

### Final result:

For the majority of images, this should be about it, and the only thing left is to put the paper sheet in the monitor without worries. However, some images reset the put values, and return to its base state when interacting with the tab. If the chosen image features this ocurrence, you should avoid:

- Closing the inspect bar or undock into separate window.

- Exiting fullscreen mode.

- Clicking the image.

Instead of Exiting fullscreen mode to enter to another tab or app, do ```Control``` + ```(Order number of another open tab)```. If the Image tab is the only open tab on the browser task, do ```Control``` + ```T``` then ```Control``` + ```2```. 
- **Pro tip**: ```Alt``` + ```F4``` doesn't close a single a tab, but the entire browser task; hope you don't need this; I did.
